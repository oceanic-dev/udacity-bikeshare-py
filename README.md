# US Bikeshare Data Analysis Terminal

### Created: June 2025

## Overview
This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Through Python data analysis, we explore riding patterns, popular stations, and user demographics to understand how bike-sharing systems are used across different urban environments.

## Features
- Interactive data filtering by city, month, and day
- Statistical analysis of ride durations
- User type and demographic insights
- Popular station and route analysis

## Files Used
- `bikeshare.py` - Main Python analysis script
- [`chicago.csv`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfb6ljrtVb7xLrGfNshBOJ0jjbnvU-kgYyGUQq8NL6o/edit?usp=sharing) - Chicago bikeshare data
- [`new_york_city.csv`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SKUHcICIIl5pz79--U01fs_PmKjkRX4qpT_dQPvxfO8/edit?usp=sharing) - NYC bikeshare data
- [`washington.csv`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ysgKl42EqJ1RwuDE8_h1Ey4mrbEcKOnFob6DC7Ah20/edit?usp=sharing) - Washington DC bikeshare data

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
3. Update the `PATH` variable in `bikeshare.py` to match the local directory of the CSV files.
4. Run `python bikeshare.py`
5. Follow the interactive prompts

## Dependencies
This project requires the following Python packages:
- NumPy (>=1.21.0)
- pandas (>=1.3.0)

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas
```

Or using the requirements.txt file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from other developers! If you have ideas for additional statistical methods or analyses that could provide more insights into the bikeshare dataset, please feel free to submit a pull request. Examples include new summary statistics and advanced visualizations.

When contributing:
- Please ensure your code is well-documented and tested.
- Add clear explanations of any new methods or metrics.
- Update the documentation and usage examples as needed.

Letâ€™s work together to make this project a comprehensive resource for bikeshare data analysis!

### Credits
The code demo for the Bikeshare Project, given by the Udacity Instructors, can be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--81WEZH6TQ). The inspiration that help craft my approach to the project (beyond the demo) stemmed from the retro terminal interface like that found in MS-DOS from the 80s.
