# US Bikeshare Data Analysis Terminal

### Created: June 2025

## Overview
This project analyzes bikeshare data from three major US cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Through Python data analysis, we explore riding patterns, popular stations, and user demographics to understand how bike-sharing systems are used across different urban environments.

## Features
- Interactive data filtering by city, month, and day
- Statistical analysis of ride durations
- User type and demographic insights
- Popular station and route analysis

## Files Used
- `bikeshare.py` - Main Python analysis script
- [`chicago.csv`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nfb6ljrtVb7xLrGfNshBOJ0jjbnvU-kgYyGUQq8NL6o/edit?usp=sharing) - Chicago bikeshare data
- [`new_york_city.csv`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1SKUHcICIIl5pz79--U01fs_PmKjkRX4qpT_dQPvxfO8/edit?usp=sharing) - NYC bikeshare data
- [`washington.csv`](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19ysgKl42EqJ1RwuDE8_h1Ey4mrbEcKOnFob6DC7Ah20/edit?usp=sharing) - Washington DC bikeshare data

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Ensure Python 3.x is installed
3. Update the `PATH` variable in `bikeshare.py` to match the local directory of the CSV files.
4. Run `python bikeshare.py`
5. Follow the interactive prompts

### Credits
The code demo for the Bikeshare Project, given by the Udacity Instructors, can be viewed on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--81WEZH6TQ). The inspiration that help craft my approach to the project (beyond the demo) stemmed from the retro terminal interface like that found in MS-DOS from the 80s.
